FileGuard Scanner üõ°Ô∏è

FileGuard Scanner is a full-stack desktop application that provides a secure environment for analyzing files for malware. Users can upload a file, and the application will calculate its hash, check it against the VirusTotal database, and generate a comprehensive PDF report. The application is built with a React frontend and a Python Flask backend, packaged into a standalone Windows executable using Electron.
